      <p><h1> A renewable energy source means energy that is sustainable - something that can't run out, or is endless, like the sun. When you hear the term 'alternative energy' it's usually referring to renewable energy sources too. It means sources of energy that are alternative to the most commonly used non-sustainable sources like coal. Renewable energy takes advantage of sources like the sun, wind, and waves, to create energy. Fossil fuels are a limited source that must be transported across the globe. It leaves us to question, how long will it last and when will the next inevitable spill take place? What happens then? By switching to renewable resources, we have an endless supply of power. It has little to no environmental impact, which is key at a time where climate change looms over us. But as with anything, change must start from the ground up. </h1></p>

        <h3>Solar, or photovoltaic (PV), cells are made from silicon or other materials that transform sunlight directly into electricity. Distributed solar systems generate electricity locally for homes and businesses, either through rooftop panels or community projects that power entire neighborhoods. Solar farms can generate power for thousands of homes, using mirrors to concentrate sunlight across acres of solar cells. Floating solar farms—or “floatovoltaics”—can be an effective use of wastewater facilities and bodies of water that aren’t ecologically sensitive.</h3>

        <h3>We’ve come a long way from old-fashioned wind mills. Today, turbines as tall as skyscrapers—with turbines nearly as wide in diameter—stand at attention around the world. Wind energy turns a turbine’s blades, which feeds an electric generator and produces electricity.</h3>

        <h3> Hydropower relies on water—typically fast-moving water in a large river or rapidly descending water from a high point—and converts the Potential Energy of that water into electricity by spinning a generator’s turbine blades.</h3>
